It Ends with Us
"I want to be you when I grow up."

When I bought this book, I thought like it was going to be another romantic book. Because it has a pink cover( the rule number one:  don't judge book by its cover)

The novel is about Lilly Bloom, who grew up in a toxic family. Her father was abusive toward her mother and so she always judged her, wondering why she didn't leave him. Why did she put up with it?

Lilly falls in love with Ryle Kincaid. Who is a smart, handsome neurosurgeon. But he has a bad temper, which causes unpleasant situations between them. After marriage, it gets  worse... .
Will she leave or stay?

The novel brings up the topic of domestic violence. It's about why women tolerate abusive men. How does this affect children? How do they feel? How difficult it is for women to make the right decision... .

An enlightening book
